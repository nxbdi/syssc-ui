SSC-UI 

The use of this software requires a CSV protocol database (not included with project source). For access to this, please contact the project team.

RUNNING NOTES

This UI was written in Python 2.7 using the PyQT library. The UI code must first be built by running 'pyuic4 ssc_widget.ui'. Then the program can be started by running the 'sscTool.py' script directly. For support building on Windows or Mac, please contact the project team.
