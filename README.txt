SSC-UI BUILD/RUN NOTES

This UI was written in Python 2.7 using the PyQT library. If the necessary libraries are installed on your system, the tool can be started by running the 'sscTool.py' script directly. The protocol database 'mpc_v5.csv' must be in the same directory.

To rebuild the UI code, type the following command:

$ pyuic4 ssc_widget.ui > ui_ssc_widget.py
